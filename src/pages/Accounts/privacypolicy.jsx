<h4>– PayPal</h4>
<p>
  We offer one or more online payment methods through the provider <strong>PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie, SCA</strong>, located at 22-24 Boulevard Royal, L-2449 Luxembourg. 
</p>
<p>
  When you select PayPal or another prepayment method, the payment information you provide during checkout (including your name, address, bank or card details, currency, and transaction ID) will be shared with PayPal. This is done in accordance with <strong>Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR</strong> solely for processing the payment. The data is transferred only to the extent required for this purpose.
</p>
<p>
  If you choose a payment method where PayPal makes advance payments, you may need to provide additional personal information (e.g., name, address, date of birth, phone number, and email) during the transaction process.
</p>
<p>
  To safeguard our legitimate interest in verifying your financial reliability, we may share this data with PayPal for credit assessment purposes, in line with <strong>Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR</strong>. PayPal uses this data, along with information such as shopping cart content and payment history, to evaluate potential payment risks.
</p>
<p>
  You may object to this data processing at any time by contacting us or PayPal. However, PayPal may still process your data if it is necessary for payment execution.

<p>
  No data will be shared beyond what is necessary for completing the transaction.

</p>
<p>
  To protect our legitimate interest in assessing creditworthiness, we may share this information with Stripe for a credit check in line with <strong>Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR</strong>. Stripe uses this data along with other factors (e.g., order history, cart value) to assess payment and default risks.
